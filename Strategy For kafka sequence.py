Creating a streaming system with data scraping, Kafka topics, and SQLite as your data store sounds like a great project! Let's break down how to effectively use `group_id` for your consumers in this multi-step process.

### System Overview
From your description, we have:

1. **Data Scraping Producing Stage**: This part of your system will scrape data and publish it to `topic1`.
2. **Consumer Stage**: The first consumer will read from `topic1`, save scraped data into an SQLite table (`table1`), and publish embeddings to `topic2`.
3. **Final Consumer Stage**: The last consumer will read from `topic2` and save embeddings into a SQL database.

### Using `group_id`
When working with Kafka consumer groups, the `group_id` helps manage offsets and allows multiple consumers to coordinate when consuming messages from a topic. Hereâ€™s a recommended approach for using `group_id` in your scenario:

#### 1. Data Scraping (Producer)
You will likely have a producer that produces messages to `topic1`. The producer does not need a `group_id`, as that is only relevant for consumers.

from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Example scrape data
scraped_data = {'id': 1, 'data': 'some scraped data'}

# Send to topic1
producer.send('topic1', value=scraped_data)
producer.flush()


#### 2. First Consumer (Reads from `topic1`)
This consumer reads messages from `topic1` and saves them into an SQLite database. You can have multiple consumers in a group if needed for load balancing.

from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import sqlite3

# Create SQLite connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('data.db')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT)')

# Create a consumer group for the first stage
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'topic1',
    group_id='data_scraper_group',  # group ID for tracking offsets
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    auto_offset_reset='earliest'
)

for message in consumer:
    data = json.loads(message.value)
    # Insert into SQLite
    cur.execute('INSERT INTO table1 (data) VALUES (?)', (data['data'],))
    conn.commit()

    # Optionally produce embeddings to topic2
    embeddings = {'id': data['id'], 'embedding': 'some embedding data'}
    # You would typically embed your data here
    producer.send('topic2', value=embeddings)

# Don't forget to close
cur.close()
conn.close()


#### 3. Second Consumer (Reads from `topic2`)
The last consumer reads from `topic2` and saves the embeddings into another SQL database (could be SQLite or another SQL system). You can give this consumer a different `group_id` if you want.

consumer2 = KafkaConsumer(
    'topic2',
    group_id='embedding_saver_group',  # Can have a different group ID
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    auto_offset_reset='earliest'
)

# Create SQLite connection (or another database)
embeddings_conn = sqlite3.connect('embeddings.db')
embeddings_cur = embeddings_conn.cursor()
embeddings_cur.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embeddings (id INTEGER, embedding TEXT)')

for message in consumer2:
    embedding_info = json.loads(message.value)
    embeddings_cur.execute('INSERT INTO embeddings (id, embedding) VALUES (?, ?)', (embedding_info['id'], embedding_info['embedding']))
    embeddings_conn.commit()

# Don't forget to close
embeddings_cur.close()
embeddings_conn.close()


### Summary
1. **Production Stage**: You produce messages to `topic1` without using a `group_id`.
2. **First Consumer**: Use a `group_id` such as `data_scraper_group` to handle offsets from `topic1`, inserting data into SQLite and potentially sending embeddings to `topic2`.
3. **Second Consumer**: Use a different `group_id`, like `embedding_saver_group`, to manage offsets while reading from `topic2` and storing the embeddings in a SQL database.

### Final Thoughts
Each consumer can have its own `group_id`, which will allow you to manage their consumption independently. If you want them to behave as a coordinated set of consumers, you could use the same `group_id`, but this is not necessary in a linear flow like yours. Always ensure to handle offsets and connection/resource management wisely, especially when dealing with databases.
